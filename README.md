Video Streaming Using Webcam in Flask Web Framework
This project demonstrates how to implement real-time video streaming using a webcam within a Flask web application. It captures video frames from the user's webcam and streams them through a web interface in real time. This setup is built using Python, Flask, and OpenCV for capturing and encoding the video feed.

Features
Real-time video streaming: The webcam feed is streamed live in the browser using Flask and OpenCV.
Efficient frame handling: Frames are captured, encoded, and served with optimized performance.
Simple and lightweight: This project provides a minimal, easy-to-understand implementation, ideal for beginners.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Flask (pip install flask)
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)

Code Explanation
Webcam Capture:

The cv2.VideoCapture(0) command is used to access the system's webcam.
Frame Generation:

Frames are continuously read from the webcam, encoded as JPEGs, and then sent as part of an HTTP response using Flask's Response object.
Video Streaming:

The generate_frames() function yields frames in a format compatible with HTML5 video streams.
The /video route serves the video feed, while the / route renders the homepage template (index.html).
Example Output
You should see the live video stream from your webcam in the browser.
